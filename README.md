Hello, I'm Martim, and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer.
In 2020 I decided to start learning to program, and since then, I have made a lot of cool projects, some for companies and others to improve my programming skills.
I'm also a student at 42 Lisbon. 42 is considered one of the best programming schools in the world.
